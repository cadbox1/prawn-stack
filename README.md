We're also using Typescript and NextJS for the frontend.

## Inspiration

The LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). I made a terrible chat app in year 10 to get around the school's internet filter.

Features:

- Free hosting.
- Good local development (with [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/)).
- Relational database.
- Fun.

Some [other people](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21567577) also agree.

I wanted to see if I could create a stack with similar qualities with more modern tools.

## Serverless

I'm a _serverless skeptic_. A few timely things swayed me to try serverless for this project.

1. [serverless-express](https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express) allows you to run an express app in Lambda, which means you can run the express part locally for a nice development experience.
1. I wanted to setup some scheduled jobs which are well suited to Lamdbda.
1. AWS CDK makes working with AWS ~~easy~~ less hard.

### The Lambda Problem

AWS makes it very difficult to achieve all 3 of these:

- Connect to a Secure RDS Database.
- Connect to the Internet.
- Cheap.

It feels very typical of AWS.

They [recommend using their NAT Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/) but [it's not cheap](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=234959).

I used a [NAT Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html) in the EC2 free tier but it's no longer maintained. Thankfully, CDK [made this easy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html#using-nat-instances) but I'm not so thankful for the extra latency it seems to cause, ~300ms (150%) more. I'm happy to pay with latency over money for this projects.

Other options include making your RDS public to all ip addresses, since lambda doesn't have a single ip address, which would be horribly insecure.

If you don't need internet access, you might be surprised learn that you need to [pay](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/) for a AWS PrivateLink to access AWS Services, like Secret Manager, which uses an interface endpoint. That would also be the case for this [Lambda proxy workaround](https://serverlessfirst.com/lambda-vpc-internet-access-no-nat-gateway/) I found.

Fun times.

## Scripts

- `docker-compose up` start the Postgres database.
- `yarn start` run the development Node server.
- `yarn dev` run the NextJS development server.
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests.
- `yarn build` build the NextJS frontend so it's ready to deploy.
- `yarn cdk bootstrap --profile account-name` prepare the AWS region for cdk deployments.
- `yarn deploy --profile account-name` build the frontend and deploy the cdk stack.
- `yarn cdk destroy --profile account-name` destroy the deployment.

## First Deploy

1. Create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
1. Enable MFA on your Root account.
1. Create an IAM user with programmtic access and assign the FullAdministratorAccess permission.
1. Download the credentials.
1. Setup your credentials with `vi ~/.aws/credentials`.
   ```
   [account-name]
   aws_access_key_id=
   aws_secret_access_key=
   ```
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. Set the region in `bin/prawn-cdk.ts`.
1. Update `yourPublicIpAddress` in `lib/prawn-stack.ts` with your public ip address so you can access the database.
1. Run `yarn cdk bootstrap --profile account-name`.
1. Run `yarn deploy --profile account-name`.
   - Takes about about 13 mins.

### Future Deploys

This takes about 1-3 mins.

```
yarn deploy --profile account-name
```

### Destroy the Stack

```
yarn cdk destroy --profile account-name
```

### Access the RDS Database

You'll need to do this to setup the database initially.

Access is currently through a whitelisted ip address which isn't ideal but will work well enough for now.

1. Make sure the `yourPublicIpAddress` in `lib/prawn-stack.ts` is up to date and deployed.
1. Login to the AWS console.
1. Go to Secret Manager.
1. Click `PrawnStack-rds-credentials`.
1. Go to the `Secret value` section then click `Retrieve secret`.
1. Enter the values into [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

### Setup the Database

1. Expand Servers, local, Databases.
1. Right-Click on Databases and create a new one called `app`.
1. Right-Click on the `app` database then select Query Tool.
1. Run the scripts from the `src/backend/migrations` folder.

### Query the Database

1. Right-Click on the app database then select Query Tool.

## Setup a Tight AWS Budget

1. Login to the root account.
1. On the account dropdown on the top right, click My Billing Dashboard.
1. Click Budgets.
1. Click Create budget.
1. Select Cost budget.
1. Fill in the budget fields then click next.
   - **Name:** Tight Budget
   - **Budgeted amount:** \$1
1. Fill in the threshold fields:
   - **Alert threshold:** 100%
   - **Emai recipients:** [your email]
1. Confirm.

### Why is AWS Charging You?

1. Login to the root account.
1. On the account dropdown on the top right, click My Billing Dashboard.
1. Click Cost Explorer.
1. Click Daily Spend View.
1. Change the timeframe to the last 7 days.
1. Group by Usage Type.

The table below will give you a decent breakdown on your charges.

## Accessing the Local Database

1. Make sure you're docker containers are up.
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
1. Go to [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/).
1. Login with:
   - **Email:** pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
   - **Password:** admin
1. Click Add New Server.
1. Fill in the local server details.
   - General
     - **Name:** local
   - Connection
     - **Host:** postgres
     - **Username:** postgres
     - **Password:** changeme
     - **Save password?:** yes

## Testing

The tests are currently failing. üôÇ

## Roadmap

### Ideas

1. Setup integration tests.
1. Setup a cron to hit an endpoint every 5 minutes. This can also act as a monitoring solution.
1. Clarify node_modules folders, possibly with yarn v2.
1. Setup a materialized view and a cron to refresh it every 5 minutes.
1. Set a maximum Lambda concurrency.
1. Use [serverless-postgres](https://github.com/MatteoGioioso/serverless-pg) for connecting to postgres.
1. Setup provisioned concurrency.
1. Move backend and frontend dev environments into docker.

### Done.

- Setup a NAT Instance to save on PrivateLink costs and allow internet access for Lambdas.
- Document the inspirations for this project.
- Setup frontend with nextjs.
- Setup pageViews in deployed environment.
- Set the NAT Gateways to 0 after being charged. Lucky I had a Budget!
- Setup pageViews with local postgres database.
- Setup serverless-express to make routing conistent for local and deployed environments.
- Setup Express to call the same handler as Lambda.
- Deploy a cdk stack with RDS and Lambda.
