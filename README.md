## Scripts

- `yarn build` build the frontend so it's ready to deploy
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests
- `yarn deploy --profile account-name` build the frontend and deploy the cdk stack
- `yarn cdk bootstrap --profile account-name` prepare the AWS region for cdk deployments
- `yarn cdk destroy --profile account-name` destroy the deployment

## First Deploy

1. Create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
1. Enable MFA on your Root account.
1. Create an IAM user with programmtic access and assign the FullAdministratorAccess permission.
1. Download the credentials.
1. Setup your credentials with `vi ~/.aws/credentials`.
   ```
   [account-name]
   aws_access_key_id=
   aws_secret_access_key=
   ```
1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. Set the region in `bin/prawn-cdk.ts`.
1. Run `yarn cdk bootstrap --profile account-name`.
1. Run `yarn deploy --profile account-name`.

### Future Deploys

```
yarn deploy --profile account-name
```

### Destroy the Stack

```
yarn cdk destroy --profile account-name
```

### Setup a Tight AWS Budget

1. On the account dropdown on the top right, Click My Account.
1. Click Budgets.
1. Click Create budget.
1. Select Cost budget.
1. Fill in the budget fields then click next.
   - **Name:** Tight Budget
   - **Budgeted amount:** \$1
1. Fill in the threshold fields:
   - **Alert threshold:** 100%
   - **Emai recipients:** [your email]
1. Confirm.

## Accessing the RDS Database

You'll need to do this to setup the database initially.

Access is currently through a whitelisted ip address which isn't ideal but will work well enough for now.

1. Make sure you enter your IP Address in the cdk code.
1. Login to AWS then go to the AWS Secret Manager for the credentials.
1. Enter them into [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

## Accessing the local database

1. Make sure you're docker containers are up.
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
1. Go to [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/).
1. Login with:
   - **Email:** pgadmin4@pgadmin.org
   - **Password:** admin
1. Click Add New Server.
1. Fill in the local server details.
   - General
     - **Name:** local
   - Connection
     - **Host:** postgres
     - **Username:** postgres
     - **Password:** changeme
     - **Save password?:** yes

### Setup a new database

1. Expand Servers, local, Databases.
1. Right-Click on Databases and create a new one called app.

### Query the database

1. Right-Click on the app database then select Query Tool.

## Testing

The tests are currently failing.

## Roadmap

### Ideas

1. Document the inspirations for this project, particularly from the LAMP stack.
1. Setup integration tests.
1. Setup a cron to hit an endpoint every 5 minutes. This can also act as a monitoring solution.
1. Clarify node_modules folders, possibly with yarn v2.
1. Setup a materialized view and a cron to refresh it every 5 minutes.
1. Set a maximum Lambda concurrency.
1. Use [serverless-postgres](https://github.com/MatteoGioioso/serverless-pg) for connecting to postgres.
1. Explain provisioned concurrency.
1. Move backend and frontend dev environments into docker.

### Done.

- Setup frontend with nextjs.
- Setup pageViews in deployed environment.
- Set the NAT Gateways to 0 after being charged. Lucky I had a Budget!
- Setup pageViews with local postgres database.
- Setup serverless-express to make routing conistent for local and deployed environments.
- Setup Express to call the same handler as Lambda.
- Deploy a cdk stack with RDS and Lambda.
